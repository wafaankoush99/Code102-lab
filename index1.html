            <h2 style="background-color: lightpink;">Today’s Loss Is Tomorrow’s Gain</h2>

            <p>Here are some tips and tricks to gain more self-control so you can choose those three future wishes over that measly immediate wish.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color: lightpink;">Learn from the Past You</h2>

            <p>Forming new habits is a great way to gain self-control and minimize future discounting. Maybe it’s a common occurrence for a coworker to show up with donuts every morning, and the sweet taste of sugary dough seems a lot more rewarding than the healthier you that will result if you stick to your diet plan. If you got in the habit of making a delicious smoothie every morning, you can reward yourself with a filling treat and avoid the hunger pangs that say, “donut now!” Changing your habits can take away the future discounting choice altogether and replace it with an automatic action.</p>

            <h2 style="background-color: lightpink;">Trick the Current You</h2>

            <p>When faced with a present vs. future choice, change your wording to make it clear there will be zero reward down the line if you take the immediate option. By saying, “I can have three wishes in a year and zero now, or one wish now and zero in a year,” rather than, “I could have one wish now or three later,” you clarify that you’ll end up with nothing, zero, zilch in the future. And won’t that be disappointing?! This simple wording change helps us understand how much we’re giving up if we go for the immediate reward.
                Here’s another trick. Diminish the delay by using specific dates: “I could have three wishes on December 31st or one wish now.” This puts the quantities at the forefront of your mind, instead of how long you’d have to wait between now and then.</p>

           

            <h2 style="background-color: lightpink;">Remember the Future You</h2>

            <p> Sometimes you forget that the future you is you.7 That future person feels like a stranger, and we aren’t keen on the idea of skipping our morning donut so that some abstract philosophical concept that resembles you (but doesn’t exist yet) can lose a few pounds and feel healthier.8 But research shows that when we remember the future you is still going to be you, just a little ways down the temporal road, it’s a lot easier to choose the option that benefits us the most. So, visualize the future you when faced with tough decisions, and make the best long-term decision for you both.</p>

            <p>It isn’t easy to change your state of mind and choose what you could have tomorrow instead of what you really want today. But with the right state of mind, your choices will shower you with bigger benefits than ever.</p>

            <p>  Now choose your future, so you will be Healthy For Good!</p>
